    "* **Eccentricity (e)**—shape of the ellipse, describing how much it is elongated compared to a circle (not marked in diagram).\n",
    "* **Semimajor axis (a)**—the sum of the periapsis and apoapsis distances divided by two. For circular orbits, the semimajor axis is the distance between the centers of the bodies, not the distance of the bodies from the center of mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two elements define the orientation of the orbital plane in which the ellipse is embedded:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Inclination (i)**—vertical tilt of the ellipse with respect to the reference plane, measured at the ascending node (where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane, the green angle i in the diagram). Tilt angle is measured perpendicular to line of intersection between orbital plane and reference plane. Any three points on an ellipse will define the ellipse orbital plane. The plane and the ellipse are both two-dimensional objects defined in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "* **Longitude of the ascending node (Ω)**—horizontally orients the ascending node of the ellipse (where the orbit passes upward through the reference plane, symbolized by ☊) with respect to the reference frame's vernal point (symbolized by ♈︎). This is measured in the reference plane, and is shown as the green angle Ω in the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining two elements are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Argument of periapsis (ω)** defines the orientation of the ellipse in the orbital plane, as an angle measured from the ascending node to the periapsis (the closest point the satellite object comes to the primary object around which it orbits, the blue angle ω in the diagram).\n",
    "* **True anomaly (ν, θ, or f) at epoch (M0)** defines the position of the orbiting body along the ellipse at a specific time (the \"epoch\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean anomaly is a mathematically convenient \"angle\" which varies linearly with time, but which does not correspond to a real geometric angle. It can be converted into the true anomaly ν, which does represent the real geometric angle in the plane of the ellipse, between periapsis (closest approach to the central body) and the position of the orbiting object at any given time. Thus, the true anomaly is shown as the red angle ν in the diagram, and the mean anomaly is not shown.\n",

    "The angles of inclination, longitude of the ascending node, and argument of periapsis can also be described as the Euler angles defining the orientation of the orbit relative to the reference coordinate system.\n",

    "Note that non-elliptic trajectories also exist, but are not closed, and are thus not orbits. If the eccentricity is greater than one, the trajectory is a hyperbola. If the eccentricity is equal to one and the angular momentum is zero, the trajectory is radial. If the eccentricity is one and there is angular momentum, the trajectory is a parabola.\n",

    "One major advantage of Keplerian orbital elements is that they allow for easy calculation orbits.  Of the six orbital elements, 5 of them remain constant during the evolution of the restricted two body problem.  Only the true anomaly `f` (or equivalently the mean anomaly `M`) change.  The parameters `a`, `e`, `inc`, `Omega` and `omega` all remain constant.<br>\n",
    "The mean anomaly `M` changes linearly with time, making it simple to evolve. In order to recover the predicted Cartesian coordinates though, we need a way to convert from the mean anomaly `M` back to the true anomaly `f`.  This can be done in two stages.<br>\n",
    "The mean anomly `M` is related to the eccentric anomaly `E` and the eccentricity `e` by **Kepler's Equation**:\n",
    "$$ M = E - e \\sin E$$\n",
    "See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation<br>\n",
    "The calculation from `E` to `M` can be done in closed form according to the above formula.  The inverse function cannot be computed symbolically, but a numerical approach such as Newton's method will converge rapidly.  This is the method used in the layer `MeanToEccentricAnomaly`.  The code is ported from Rebound.  There is some subtlety involved in using Tensorflow operations (tf.cond must be used in place of an if statement) but it's not too complicated.<br>\n",
    "The second step is to convert from the eccentric anomaly `E` to the true anomaly `f`.  This is easy and accomplished by a one liner:\n",
