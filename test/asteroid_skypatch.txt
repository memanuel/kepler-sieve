********************************************************************************
Test skypatch segments by comparing two directions:
(1) spline  : Take the midpoint time of each segment, and spline the direction of the asteroid using output of make_spline_ast_dir().
(2) skypatch: Take the center of the reported skypatch in that segment.

Angle Difference: skypatch vs. spline in arc seconds
*Mean  :      49.1*
 Median:      47.3
 Max   :     148.7
**** PASS ****
